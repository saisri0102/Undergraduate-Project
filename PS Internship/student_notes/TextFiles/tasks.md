    - Why Shorthand are not preferred. (Why should we prefer using longer version)
    - font weight: 100 -900 bold
    - font-style: italic
    - text-decoration: underline, overline, line-through, none
    - text-transform: uppercase, lowercase, capitlize
    - text-align:left,right,justify,center
    - word-spacing, letter-spacing


    - Why Shorthand are not preferred. (Why should we prefer using longer version)

    1. when a property value is left out in a shorthand declaration, that property takes on its default value 
    1. what if we miss a property or two in the declaration? 
    In the above example, let’s say we ignored border-style. We won’t be able to see the borders anymore, 
    not because the shorthand property didn’t work but because the border-style which we left out, got the default value none

    Background origin
    - specifies the origin position (the background positioning area) of a background image.
    Ex: background-origin:padding-box;
        -Then image starts from padding starting itself
    background-origin:border-box;
    - The background is positioned relative to the border box
    - The background  starts from the upper left corner of the border.
    - Then image starts from border starting itself
    background-origin:content-box;
    - Then image starts from content starting itself

    - Read up on clearfix class( pseudo element: ::after/::before)
    - Try to use diplay:inline-block to get a 3-column layout
    - check 3d rotation.
