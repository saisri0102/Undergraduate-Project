# Feature detetction using Modernizr
_Modernizr_ is a library for detection of HTML5, CSS and JS features supported by a browser.  

This demo shows configuration and building Modernizr script from source. It uses the CSS classes set on the root element to load gradient background (if supported), or a fallback background image otherwise. Similarly, it detects if MathML is supported, and loads MathJax as a fallback library if MathML is not supported (MathML is used to render mathematical expressions in HTML).
