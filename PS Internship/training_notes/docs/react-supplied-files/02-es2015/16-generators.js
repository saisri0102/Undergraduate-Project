// Step 1: Make this a generator function that "yields" initValue each time, and increasing initValue each time we step through to next yield. After yielding thrice it returns.
function foo( initValue ) {
}

// Step 2: Get an iterator to start executing the function. Use it to execute the function to completion.

// Step 3: Define a counter generator function that yields a new integer each time it is called. Try it out once you define the function.
