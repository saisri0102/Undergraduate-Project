# Cloud computing
- Outsourcing resources, i.e. resources are given as a service
    - computing - we want to run application
    - storage - we want to store files / data
    - network - we want the services that make up our application to communicate with each other
- Upfront costs are very high
    - Only big companies can maintain their own data centers
        - It is a cost even for them
- Variable costs will also come down
    - Economies of scale - per unit cost of resource is lower in cloud
- Cloud service providers
    - Amazon Web Services
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Google Cloud Platform
- No upfront cost
    - We "pay as we use the resources"
- Our application is up and running
- The infrastructure is up and running
- Maintenance is taken care (managed)
- Scaling resources as per need
